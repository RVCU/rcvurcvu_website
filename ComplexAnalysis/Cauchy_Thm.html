<h5> Notes on Cauchys Theroem </h5>
<p class="border"> 
So from notes on complex integration we covered how integration on complex functions is like path integrals for functions on $\mathbb{R}^2$ To summarize some of the important facts we learn we will INVOKE THE PATH INDEPENDENCE THEOREM
<br>
THEOREM: Let D be open and connected (a domain) then suppose that $f:D \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is continuous then The following are equivalent
<ul>
	<li>1. There exists a $F:D \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ that is holomorphic such that $F'=f$</li> 
	<li>2. For all closed paths $\gamma \in D$ we have that $\int_{\gamma}f = 0$ </li>
	<li>3. For all points $z_0,z_1 \in D$ and for all p-wise smooth paths $\gamma,\tau \in D$ from $z_0 \rightarrow z_1$ we have $\int_{\gamma}f = \int_{\tau}f$	</li>
</ul>
<p class="defn">
number 2 there is pretty nuts if you think about it, just having that all closed path integrals are 0 gives that ALL paths that connect two points give the same integral. This follows from having closed path integrals being =0 then we can construct a closed path from $z_0 \rightarrow z_0$ by connecting the two paths between $z_0 \rightarrow z_1$ $\gamma$ and $\tau$. This forms a closed loop around which equals 0 which leads to them being identical.
<br> <br>

Now to introduce Cauchy's Integral Theorem. This theorem concerns integrating around closed loops. I will now introduce the result and then I will go step by step through the necessary "machinery" that makes proving this possible. 
<br>
<br>
Cauchy's Theorem (For Star-shaped regions): Let D be a star-shaped region and let $f:D \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ be holomorphic. Then for any closed path $\gamma$ in D, 
$$\int_{\gamma}f =0$$ 
The idea to proving this result will be to pick a point $z_0 \in D$ about which it is star shaped and then by defining a $F$ as $F(z) = \int_{[z_0 \rightarrow z]}f(w)dw$ Which should give us $F'=f$ so we can then use the PATH INDEPENDENCE THEOREM above (specifically number 1) to show the result is true.
<br> <br>
This is a little hard to tackle directly and we should try to prove some other things that will make it neater first.
First let's try to prove this result around a more concrete path shape like a triangle which we can then use to prove the original result.
<br> <br>
 A triangle T is a path between three points, not linear dependent, of the form $[z_0 \rightarrow z_1] + [z_1 \rightarrow z_2] + [z_2 \rightarrow z_0]$.
We will skip the proof of this result but we can put an upper bound on a continuous function over a triangle more precisely than the one we proved for general paths. 
<br>
LEMMA: Let D be a domain and let $f:D \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ be holomorphic. Then for all $z_0 \in D$, and $\forall \epsilon > 0$, $\exists \delta > 0$ such that for $B_{\delta}z_0 \subset D$ and for all triangles within that ball $T \subset B_{\delta}(z_0)$
$$|\int_{T}f(z)dz| \leq \epsilon l(T) sup_{z \in T}{|z-z_0|}$$
We use this result to prove the corresponding Cauchy theorem for Triangular paths.
<br>
THEOREM (CIT FOR TRIANGLES): suppose that $f$ is holomorphic on a domain D, suppose that $T_0$ is a triangle with convex hull about $T_0$ being inside D ($co(T_0) \subset D$ then $\int_{T_0}f=0$ 
<br>
So I definitely won't prove this as its a lot to type but the general idea is that we can split up any triangle within D into 4 equal triangles internally and assuming $\int_{T}f=c \neq 0 $ we get that one of these 4 triangles must have integral value greater than or equal to $frac{c}{4}$ (This is shown by looking carefully at the paths about the smaller triangles within the big triangle) and continuing this splitting process of the triangles  and subtriangles you get that
$$|int_{T_n}f| \geq \frac{1}{4^n}|c|$$ which contradicts our lemma about upper bounds for triangle pathed integrals! Leading to a contradiction meaning
$$\int_{T}f=0$$
as we wanted to show.
<br> 
This is great now we can use this to prove the general case.
<br><br>
Proof of general case(Cauchys theorem):
defining $F(z)= \int_{[z_0 \rightarrow z]}f(w)dw$ where $z_0$ is in D and is star-shaped about it. We want to show that $F'(z_1)=f(z_1), \forall z \in D$
<br>
i.e. $lim_{z \rightarrow z_1} \frac{F(z)-F(z_1)}{z-z_1}=f(z_1)$
<br>
Looking at The numerator $F(z)-F(z_2) = \int_{[z_0 \rightarrow z]}f - \int_{[z_0 \rightarrow z_1]}f$
<br>
If we were to draw out the three point we are talking about $z_0,z_1,z$ we could draw a triangle about them called T and so,
<br>
$= \int_{T}f - \int_{z \rightarrow z_1}f = \int_{z_1 \rightarrow z}f $ by the CIT for triangles. Using this equality for the numerator we can solve the equation 
$$ | \frac{F(z)-F(z_1)}{z-z_1} -f(z_1)|$$
to show it is less than a given $\epsilon$ using the approximation lemma for triangles meaning that $F'=f$ and by path independence theorem we have that $\int_{\gamma}f=0$!

<br><br>
Now a very interesting effect of this theoerem is that we gain a tool to use when comparing the value of an integral over paths that are inside one another (picture a closed loop $\gamma$ being a circle inside a larger closed path $\tau$ as a square around $\gamma$) then we can cut the space in between $gamma$ and $tau$ into a bunch of closed loops (check lecture notes for a good diagram of this). The result of this will be you get say, 4 closed loops that form the space between $gamma$ and $tau$, the sides of the loops that are "touching" inside the space will cancel out as they are the same line (hand wavey) and the sides of the paths on the outside are equal to $tau$ exactly and the inside of the closed paths are $-\gamma$ exactly meaning we get that a bunch of closed path interals (=0) are equal to $\int_{tau}f - \int_{gamma} $ $\Rightarrow $ they are the same! So we have proven that if we can draw a big closed path about a smaller closed path. or vice versa, where the properties of the function still hold we have that the value of the integral over the two paths is the same! Pretty cool seeing as these paths can be very different I'm sure. The general result follows.
<br><br>  
THEOREM: Let $z_1,z_2 \in \mathbb{C}$ and let $p_1,p_2 >0$ such that $p_1 >p_2 + |z_1-z_2|$. Suppose that there exists a $r_1>p_1$, $r_2 < p_2 $ then if $f$ is differentiable on $A:=\{z \in \mathbb{C}: |z-z_1|< r_1 \text{and} |z-z_2|>r_2\}$ then
$$ \int_{C_{p_1(z_1)}}f = \int_{C_{p_2(z_2)}}f $$


COROLLARY: The integral $\int_{C_r(a)} \frac{1}{z-z_0}dz$
has value $2\pi$ if $z_0\in B_r(a)$ and value 0 if $z_0 \notin \bar{B_r(a)}$
