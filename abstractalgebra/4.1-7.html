Let f(x) and g(x) be non-zero polynomials in R[x] and assume that the leading coefficient of one of them is a unit. Show that \( f(x)g(x) \neq 0 \) and that \( deg(f(x)g(x) = deg(g(x)) + deg(f(x)) \)
</p>

<p class="border">
assume that f has a unit as it's leading coefficient. So we write f(x) and g(x) as 
$$f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + ... + a_nx^n \quad g(x) = b_0 + b_1x + ... + b_mx^m \textrm{ where \(a_n\) is a unit and \(b_m \neq 0\)}$$
then assume that \(f(x)g(x) = 0\) then 
$$a_n b_m = 0 \Rightarrow a_n^{-1}a_nb_m = b_m = 0$$ which is a contradiction. This also proves the second part of the question.
