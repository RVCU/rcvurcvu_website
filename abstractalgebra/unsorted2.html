1. Prove that the sum of all elements of a finite field is zero (except for \(F_2\)).
</p>


<p class="border">
As F is a finite field we have that the characteristic of F must be a prime p and the order of F is \( p^k \) for some \(k \in N\).
let \(\{a_1,a_2,...,a_{p^n}\}\) be the elements of F and as \(|F| \geq 2\) we can choose an element \(\alpha \neq \{0,1\} \) of F and and so multiplying \(\{a_1,a_2,...,a_{p^n}\}\) by \(\alpha\) gives \(\{\alpha a_1,\alpha a_2,...,\alpha a_{p^n}\}\). Note that this multiplication permutes the elements of \(\{a_1,a_2,...,a_{p^n}\}\) as F is closed under multiplication and if \(\alpha a_i = \alpha a_j \) then by cancellation \( a_i= a_j\). Using this we get 
$$a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{p^n} = \alpha a_1 + \alpha + a_2 + ... + \alpha a_{p^n} $$
$$ 1 + a_2 + ... + a_{p^n} - ( \alpha a_1 + \alpha + a_2 + ... + \alpha a_{p^n}) = 0 $$
$$(1-\alpha)(1 + a_2 + ... + a_{p^n}) = 0$$
and as we have that \( \alpha \neq \{0,1\} \) we get that \(1 + a_2 + ... + a_{p^n} = 0\)
