<body>
<p>
\( j \rightarrow i \) : page j has a link to page i (j pointing to i))
</br>

Question: What is an important page?
<ul>
<li> we do not take into account the content of the page</li>
<li> "roots" have many links to them and "branches" have less. Roots seemto be more important</li>
</ul>
<p>
I denote by \( \mu_i \geq 0 \) the importance of page i 
</p>

<p>

First Idea: An important webpage recieves many links and inversely we assume that a page that recieves many links is important 
</br>
I define \( \mu_i = \sum_{j \rightarrow i} 1 \) ( \( \mu_i \) is equal to the number of pages pointed to i). A weakness in this scheme is you can artificially increase the importance of a webpage by creating dummy web pages that link to it.
</p>

<p>
Second Idea: Weighting Counter,
</br>
Some pages have many links, each of these links should then be less valued then from a page with only a few links.
